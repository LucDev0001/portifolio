I have completed the refactoring of your portfolio. Here is a summary of the changes:

*   **Structural Correction:** The 'Certifications' section has been moved before the 'Contact' section.
*   **Project Links Correction:** The project modal has been removed, and the project links now open in a new tab.
*   **Form Correction:** The contact form now uses a POST method and a formspree.io URL.
*   **Dependencies and SEO:** I have added the Tailwind CSS CDN to the `<head>` to ensure that styles are applied correctly, as well as meta tags for SEO and social sharing, including JSON-LD and Twitter Cards.
*   **Performance:** I have added `loading="lazy"` to all images to improve performance.
*   **CV Download Button:** A download button for your CV has been added to the 'About Me' section.
*   **Back to top button:** A 'Back to top' button has been added to the page.
*   **Typing effect:** A typing effect has been added to the main heading.

Please review your portfolio and let me know if you have any other questions.
